The file /facial-recognition-app/facial-recognition-app/model/model.h5 is a binary file that contains the trained model weights and architecture. As such, it cannot be represented as text content. This file is typically generated by the training script (model/train.py) when the model is saved after training.

Therefore, the contents of model.h5 cannot be provided in a text format. It will be created and populated when you run the training script.
